# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C / C++

This repository contains **structured resources, notes, and implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms using C and C++**, designed mainly for **B.Tech / B.E. students** and anyone learning DSA from scratch.

The content follows a **college-first, exam-oriented approach**, aligned with common Indian university syllabi (AICTE-based), while also building strong fundamentals for interviews.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- To provide **clear and simple implementations** of DSA concepts in C/C++
- To act as a **companion resource** for video lectures and classes
- To help students **practice and revise** important topics for:
  - Semester exams  
  - Internships  
  - Entry-level interviews
- To maintain a **single, evolving collection** of DSA resources

# Time Complexity Examples (C / C++)

This folder contains simple and exam-oriented programs
demonstrating different time complexities.

## Files Included
- O(1) – Constant Time
- O(n) – Linear Time
- O(n²) – Quadratic Time
- O(log n) – Logarithmic Time
- O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time

Each file contains multiple examples to clearly explain
the behavior of that complexity.

## 🛠 Languages Used
- **C**
- **C++** (without heavy STL, to keep logic transparent)

---

## 👨‍🎓 Target Audience
- B.Tech / B.E. students (Semester 2–4)
- Beginners learning DSA
- Students following a **DSA course or YouTube playlist**
- Anyone who prefers **C/C++ for strong fundamentals**

---
